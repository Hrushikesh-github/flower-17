Contains 17-flowers dataset from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/
The difference is I have arranged them into their respective classes using a python code made by me which can be found 
in my python_notes repository.

I donot own the copyrights and the sole purpose of making this repo is for ease of access using google colab
